            <div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:.5em; font-size: 30px'>1.1 What is a Cloud Variable?</div>

            A Cloud Variable is a piece of data that is stored in the cloud and
            is associated with a particular device.

            <br><br>
            Cloud Variables are designed to address some of the common
            engineering challenges encountered when developing IoT devices and
            applications:
            <ul>
                <li>Time-series sensor data storage in the cloud.</li>
                <li>Device status reporting &amp; monitoring.</li>
                <li>Remote device configuration.</li>
                <li>Remote device control.</li>
            </ul>

            In many ways, a Cloud Variable is like a traditional variable in a
            computer program.
            Each Cloud Variable has a name, such as <div class=icode>temperature</div>.
            Each has a datatype, such as <div class=icode>float32</div>.  Each
            has a value, such as <div class=icode>98.7</div>.  Cloud Variables
            may be members of structures (<div class=icode>gps.latitude</div>),
            and the structures themselves are considered Cloud Variables (<div class=icode>gps</div>).  You can create arrays of Cloud Variables (<div class=icode>cpu_level[3]</div>) as well as associative arrays
            (<div class=icode>weight['Johny']</div>).

            <br><br>
            In other ways, Cloud Variables are critically different from normal
            programming variables.  First of all, Cloud Variables are stored
            in a NoSQL database and are accessed using RESTful web-based
            protocols.  This makes them several orders-of-magnitude slower than
            normal variables, but also makes them persistent and accessible
            from anywhere in world (or at least anywhere with an internet
            connection).  A second difference is that the historical values for
            each Cloud Variable are saved in the database and kept for some
            time.  This makes them well-suited for storing
            sensor data and other time-series data.  A third difference is that
            each Cloud Variable has additional <b>metadata</b> associated with it
            that may include input validation constraints (<div
            class=icode>min-value : -50.0</div>), units (<div class='icode'>units : "degrees_c"</div>) and hints about usage for
            third-party applications (<div class='icode'>numeric-display-hint : "scientific"</div>).

            <br><br>

            Developing a cloud-managed product is a complicated undertaking,
            and Canopy Cloud Variables are just one piece of the puzzle.  That
            said, Cloud Variables are an extremely useful abstraction that
            can accelerate IoT product development dramatically.

            <div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:.5em; font-size: 30px'>1.2 Supported Languages and Platforms</div>

            Canopy Cloud Variables are intended to be <b>agnostic</b> to
            programming language, IDE, and hardware platform.  To achieve this,
            we embrace web technologies (such as HTTP, REST, WebSockets, and
            JSON) which are supported in nearly every programming language on
            practically every hardware platform.
            
            <br><br>The reality, however, is slightly murkier.  Although you
            <i>could</i> use our <b>HTTP REST API</b> directly, doing
            so may involve a lot of code and may not have great performance.
            You would <i>much rather</i> use a <b>Native Client
            Library</b>.  The Native Client Libraries are easier to use and
            have better performance because they use WebSockets to communicate
            with the server.

            <br><br>At this time, we have official support for the following
            Native Client Libraries:

            <ul>
                <li><b>Embedded:</b> C Client Library (requires linux-based OS)</li>
                <li><b>Application:</b> Javascript Client Library (in-browser only)</li>
            </ul>

            If you are a developer, one of the best ways to contribute
            to the Canopy open source project is to develop a Native
            Client Library for your favorite language.

            <div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:.5em; font-size: 30px'>1.3 The Players</div>

            One more topic before we dive in: Cloud
            Variables are used by different parties in different ways.  It is
            important to understand who all the "players" are and how Cloud
            Variables enable interoperability between them.

            <br><br>
            <b>Embedded developers</b>.  Embedded developers are the folks who
            write "firmware" that runs on the IoT device's SoC or
            microcontroller.  Embedded developers use Cloud Variables to report
            device status and sensor readings to the cloud, and also to receive
            remote control and configuration instructions.

            <br><br>
            <b>Application developers</b>.  Application developers are the
            people who write mobile, web, desktop, and/or server applications
            that remotely monitor and control IoT devices.  Application
            developers may read and/or modify a device's Cloud Variables
            provided they have appropriate credentials and permissions.

            <br><br>
            There are two types of application developer.  An <b>in-house
            application developer</b> works for the same company that is
            developing the IoT product.  A <b>third-party application
            developer</b> is independent and does not work for that company.  Cloud Variables may be used by either
            type of app developer, as long as the Cloud Variable's
            permissions are configured to allow it.

            <br><br>
            <b>Cloud operations engineer</b>.  Cloud operations engineers setup
            and maintain the server instances that run the Canopy Cloud
            Service.  They are responsible for configuring and scaling the
            Cloud Service and the Cassandra database (used by the Cloud
            Service).  One option is to use our <b>free or premium hosting
            services</b>, in which case you will not need any cloud operation
            engineers.

            <br><br>
            <b>End user</b>.  The end user interacts with both the physical
            device and the device's application(s), but does not directly use
            (or even know about) Canopy or Cloud Variables.  Just like you
            don't know (or care) whether Apache or Nginx is serving you this
            web page.

            <div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:.5em; font-size: 30px'>1.4 "Hello IoT"</div>
            Ok, enough talk: let's see Cloud Variables in action.

            <br><br>
            First, you need a type-4 UUID to identify your "device".  You can generate one from the linux
            command-line with:
            <div class=code>uuid -v4</div>
            or you can use this one (which is dynamically generated each time this page is reloaded):

            <div class=code><script>document.write('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g,
                        function(c) { var r = Math.random()*16|0, v = c == 'x'
                        ? r : (r&0x3|0x8); return v.toString(16); }));</script></div>

            Whenever the Canopy Cloud Service encounters a UUID for the first
            time, it creates a new <b>device resource</b>.  The <b>device
            resource</b> does not necessarily correspond to a real, physical IoT
            device (although it typically does).  In this example, our "device"
            will just be you sending some commands to the server with <div class=icode>curl.

            <br><br>
            Now that you have a UUID for your "device" (write it down!), you
            can create a Cloud Variable by sending the following payload:

            <div class=code>{
    "vars" : {
        "hello_iot" : 123.45
    }
}</div>

            You can send this payload from the linux command-line with:

            <div class=code>curl -d '{"vars" : { "hello_iot" : 123.45 } }' http://sandbox.canopy.link/di/&ltUUID&gt;</div>
            Be sure to replace &lt;UUID&gt; with your UUID.


            <div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:.5em; font-size: 30px'>1.2 Getting Started Using CURL</div>
            
            The
            device stores a <b>local copy</b> of the variable's metadata and value.
            In parallel, the cloud stores a <b>remote copy</b>.  A
            synchronization process updates both copies with the latest data.
            <br><br>
            Cloud Variables are stored by the Canopy Cloud Service using a
            Cassandra database.
