    <h2><a name=intro />Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Canopy is an open source Internet of Things platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        Canopy takes a description of a physical object's capabilities, as
        provided in an SDDL file (more on that later), and from that
        description exposes a RESTful web service for monitoring and
        controlling the object.
    </p>
    <p>
        Canopy's server-side components are designed to scale to,
        potentially, millions of connected devices.  The generality and
        flexibility of Canopy makes it a powerful platform choice whenever
        cloud-management is needed.
    </p>

    <h2><a name=intro />Hardware Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        Canopy requires a hardware platform with similar specifications to a
        Raspberry Pi or Beagle Bone.  Canopy <i>does not</i> work on the
        Arduino platform, at present.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, a network connection (TCP/IP) is required, over ethernet,
        wifi, or 4G LTE, between the device and the Canopy Cloud Service.
        Canopy is designed for WiFi networks, and at present does not support
        Zigbee, ZWave, bluetooth, or other communication protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
        Canopy requires a linux-based OS on the device, such as Raspian or
        Archlinux.  Canopy has not been tested on Android or RiscOS.
    </p>

    <h4>Recommended System Requirements:</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>ARM SOC w/ 1GHz cpu or higher</li>
            <li>128 MB RAM
            <li>Ethernet, WiFi, or 4G LTE connectivity</li>
            <li>Linux-based OS</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        

    <h2><a name=intro />Features</h2>

    <p>
        Canopy has several features that simplify the development of
        high-quality IoT products. 
    </p>

    <h4>Automatic embedded code generation</h4>
    <p>
        Based on your product's SDDL file, the <i>canogen</i> tool will
        automatically generate C template code for your device.  Just implement
        a few device-specific routines (such as writing to GPIO pins) and
        you've got yourself a Canopy-enabled smart product!
    </p>

    <h4>Sensor data collection and archiving</h4>
    <p>
        The Canopy Cloud Service receives periodic status updates from each
        connected device.  It stores sensor data, device status, and control
        events in a Cassandra database and makes this big data available for
        monitoring and analysis.
    </p>

    <h4>Low-latency remote control</h4>
    <p>
        Control instructions issued from the web are forwarded to the
        appropriate device in a matter of milliseconds.
    </p>

    <h4>User account management and device sharing</h4>
    <p>
        The Canopy Cloud Service has built-in user account management 
        and device sharing systems.  Users can choose who else can control and
        monitor their devices, and leave comments about particular devices for
        other users to see.  These features make Canopy a veritable social
        network for IoT.
    </p>

    <h4>Flexible deployment options</h4>
    <p>
        The Canopy Cloud Service is a golang application that can be run almost
        anywhere.  For convenience, we maintain a hosted deployment that you
        can use.  But if you choose, you can start up your own deployment on
        EC2, in your own datacenter, on your corporate LAN, or on your laptop.
    </p>

    <h4>Device Management Frontend</h4>
    <p>
        You may choose to build your own custom frontend for your
        Canopy-enabled products.  But until that's ready, you can use our
        generic device management frontend to monitor and control your devices.
