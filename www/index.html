        <div style="padding-top:8px; text-align:justify">The next billion devices to join the Internet won't be PCs, tablets or
        smartphones.  Instead they'll be household appliances, motor vehicles,
        industrial machines, environmental sensors, and even fashion
        accessories.  The Internet of Things is the next big technological
        revolution and it will forever change the way we interact
        with our surroundings.<br><br>

        This revolution is too important to be based on proprietary
        platforms and corporate agendas.  That is why we are working night and
        day to create an open platform, along with open standards, to power this
        movement.<br><br>

        Yes, we have lofty goals and a long journey ahead.  But
        we need to begin somewhere, and <span class=logo-in-text-light>canopy</span>
        is that beginning.<br><br>
