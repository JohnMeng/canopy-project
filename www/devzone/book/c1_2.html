<h3>1.2 About Canopy</h3>
<h4>Brief History of Canopy</h4>
<p>
    Greg Prisament started Canopy as an open source project in April 2014.
    Previously, he had worked as a software architect at PowerCloud Systems
    (acquired by Comcast) and Ubiquiti Networks.
</p>
<p>
    These roles introduced Greg to the awesomeness of cloud-managed devices.
    The products he worked on (such as the <a
    href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/110098832/skydog-your-home-network-reinvented'>SkyDog
    Router</a>) could be monitored and controlled over the web using apps.  But
    he also experienced first-hand the vast complexity and difficulty of
    bringing "smart" products to market.  He knew there needed to be a better
    way.
</p>
<p>
    Greg started Canopy with a clear goal: <b>to simplify the development of
    cloud-enabled products.</b>
</p>
<p>
    After reading a book on the origins of the World Wide Web, Greg was
    inspired by how open source software and royalty-free protocols enabled the
    web to take off.  As such, Greg committed early on to building open source
    software and royalty-free protocols for IoT.
