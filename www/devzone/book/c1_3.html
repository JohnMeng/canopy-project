<h3>1.3 Getting Started: Canopy Basics</h3>
<h4>Components of Canopy</h4>
<p>
    Canopy is a collection of software tools and libraries that simplify the
    development of cloud-enabled products.  By <b>"cloud-enabled
    product"</b>, we mean any physical device with a connection to the internet
    that can be monitored and/or controlled over the web.  Such products may
    include consumer appliances, industrial equipment, and other "Internet of
    Things" devices.
</p>
<p>
    A cloud-enabled product needs software to run in several places: on the
    device, in the cloud, and within client-side applications.  Canopy contains
    sub-projects for each of these:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Canopy Embedded Development Kit (EDK)</b> software runs on the device.</li>
        <li><b>Canopy Cloud Service (CCS)</b> software runs server-side.</li>
        <li><b>Canopy Application Development Kit (ADK)</b> software runs within
        an application. For example: on a smartphone or in a web browser.</li>
    </ul>

    Depending on your role, you may need to use just one of these
    components.  A firmware developer will likely only use the <b>Canopy
    EDK</b>, whereas a frontend app developer will likely only use the
    <b>Canopy ADK</b>.
</p>
<p>
    That said, we believe the best way to master Canopy is to understand all of
    the components and how they work together.  Throughout this guide, we
    intermix our discussion to talk about all components.  You can skip
    past sections if you know they are not relevant to you, and sometimes will
    we give recommendations letting you know that you can safely skip a section.
</p>

<h4>Canopy Features</h4>
<h5>Cloud Variables</h5>
<p>
    The main feature of Canopy is called <b>Canopy Cloud Variables</b>.  A
    <b>Cloud Variable</b> is a piece of "state" (i.e., data) that can be
    accessed by firmare but is stored in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Cloud Variables</b> are a powerful concept because of their generality
    and their easy-of-use.  <b>Cloud Variables</b> can be used for:
    <ul>
        <li>Remote monitoring of sensor data</li>
        <li>Remote control over the web</li>
        <li>Device status reporting</li>
        <li>Device configuration</li>
    </ul>
    We will discuss <b>Cloud Variables</b> in detail in Chapter 2.
</p>
<h5>Account &amp; Device Management</h5>
<p>
    Canopy has a built-in permission system with cloud-based <b>Account</b> and
    <b>Device</b> resources.  This permission system controls who can access
    each Device's data securely.
</p>
<h5>Protocols: REST (HTTP) and Websockets</h5>
<p>
    The <b>Canopy Cloud Service (CCS)</b> is the core component of Canopy.
    The other components, namely the <b>EDK</b> and <b>ADK</b>, interact with
    the <b>CCS</b> through web-based protocols.
</p>
<p>
    At this time, two protocols are supported:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Canopy REST API</b> is a RESTful Web API that uses HTTP(S) with
            JSON payloads.
        </li>
        <li><b>Canopy Websocket Protocol</b> is a websocket protocol with
        JSON payloads.
        </li>
    </ul>

    The <b>EDK</b> can be configured to use either protocol, whereas the
    <b>ADK</b> currently only supports the <b>REST API</b>.
<p>
    Embedded and application developers may use the <b>REST API</b> directly.
    This allows Canopy to be used from practically any language and platform.
    However, if EDK/ADK support is available for your language &amp; platform,
    it is easier to use those libraries.
</p>
<h4>What's Inside?</h4>
<p>
    Let's take a brief look at what is inside each sub-project.
</p>
<h5>Canopy Embedded Development Kit (EDK)</h5>
<p>
    The <b>EDK</b> contains tools and software for embedded development using
    Canopy.
    <ul>
        <li><b>libcanopy</b> is a C library that runs on the device as part of
        the "firmware".</li>
        <li><b>canotool</b> is a multi-purpose tool that helps with
        device provisioning and other tasks.
    </ul>
    The <b>EDK</b> also contains:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Other libraries</b> that <b>libcanopy</b> depends on (including third-party libraries like <b>libwebsockets</b>).</li>
        <li><b>Unit tests</b> and <b>sample programs</b>.
        <li>A <b>build system</b> for compiling all of the code.
    </ul>

    The <b>Canopy EDK</b> is an open source project consisting of several
    <code>git</code> repositories.  It uses the <code>repo</code> tool to
    manage the multiple repositories.
</p>
<h5>Canopy Cloud Service</h5>
<p>
    The <b>CCS</b> contains Canopy's server-side components.
    <ul>
        <li><b>canopy-cloud-service</b> is the main server-side process,
        written in Go-lang.</li>
    </ul>
    The <b>CCS</b> also contains:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Install scripts</b> for installing the cloud service.
        <li><b>Configuration files</b> for configuring the cloud service.
        <li><b>init.d scripts</b> for starting and stopping the cloud service.
    </ul>

    The <b>CCS</b> uses Cassandra for data storage.  So in addition to
    configuring/operating the <b>CCS</b>, you must also configure/operate a
    Cassandra database cluster.
</p>
<p>
    If you use our free or premium hosting solutions, we take care of operating
    the <b>CCS</b> and Cassandra database for you.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Canopy Cloud Service</b> is an open source project available on
    github:<br><a target=_blank
    href=http://github.com/canopy-project/canopy-cloud>http://github.com/canopy-project/canopy-cloud</a>.
</p>
<h5>Canopy Application Development Kit</h5>
<p>
    The <b>ADK</b> contains libraries for application developers, providing
    language-specific bindings that are easier to use compared to using the REST API
    directly.
    <ul>
        <li><b>canopy.js</b> provides a Javascript wrapper around the <b>Canopy REST API</b>.
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Currently, only Javascript is supported, although we hope to add bindings
    for other languages soon.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>Canopy ADK</b> is an open source project available on github:<br><a target=_blank href=http://github.com/canopy-project/canopy-js-client>http://github.com/canopy-project/canopy-js-client</a>.
