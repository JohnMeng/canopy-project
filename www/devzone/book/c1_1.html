<h3>1.1 Getting Started: About Cloud-Enabled Devices</h3>
<h4>Technological Trends That Are Enabling IoT</h4>
<p>
    There is certainly a lot of buzz about the "Internet of Things"
    these days.  But looking past the hype, there are some powerful
    technological trends at play that are changing the way we interact with
    physical devices:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cheap, small, &amp; efficient processors:</b> Demand from the
        smartphone industry has driven down the cost, size, and power
        consumption of embedded microprocessors.</li>

        <li><b>The Cloud:</b> The maturity and commoditization of cloud
        infrastructure has made it easier than ever to build scalable,
        highly-available cloud-based services.
        </li>

        <li><b>Improved Wireless</b>: New technologies like Bluetooth LE,
        6LOPAN, and Thread are simplifying RF communications and bringing down
        the cost and power consumption of wireless interactions.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h5>The Result is IoT</h5>
<p>
    These trends together are fundamentally changing how consumers interact
    with products.  As it continues to become cheaper and easier for
    manufacturers to create "smart" Internet-connected products, the
    incremental cost to build a "smart" product vs "traditional" product is
    trending towards zero.  When the <i>cloud</i> and <i>apps</i> enter the picture, it is
    easy to imagine a world where nearly every device has a
    <i>physical interface (mechanical)</i> as well as a <i>virtual interface (software)</i>.
</p>
<h5>The Cloud's Role</h5>
<p>
    The <i>cloud </i> is an important piece of the IoT puzzle, because it
    enables remote control and monitoring of devices over the web.  Without it,
    only local/proximal interactions are possible.
</p>
<h5>IoT "Design Patterns"</h5>
<p>
    There are many paths an IoT device can take to get to the Internet.  Some examples:
    <ul>
        <li>Device &rarr; WiFi router &rarr; Internet</li>
        <li>Device &rarr; Zigbee hub &rarr; Wifi router &rarr; Internet</li>
        <li>Device &rarr; GSM cell tower &rarr; Internet</li>
        <li>Device &rarr; Bluetooth smartphone &rarr; cell tower &rarr; Internet</li>
    </ul>

    No matter how the device reaches the Internet, there needs to be something
    <i>there</i> for it to talk to.  That's where <b>Canopy</b> comes in.
    <b>Canopy</b> is at it's core a <i>cloud service </i> that sits between IoT
    devices and IoT apps.  <b>Canopy</b> helps you create a cloud-based virtual
    interface for your device.
