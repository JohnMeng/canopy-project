<h3>1.1 Getting Started: About Cloud-Enabled Devices</h3>
<h4>Technological Trends That Are Enabling IoT</h4>
<p>
    There is certainly a lot of buzz about the "Internet of Things"
    these days.  But looking past the hype, there are some powerful
    technological trends at play that are changing the way we interact with
    physical devices.
</p>

<h5>Cheap &amp; Small Processors</h5>
<p>
    First of all, demand from the smartphone industry has driven down the
    cost, size, and power consumption of microprocessors.  On the one hand,
    this can be simply be viewed as Moore's Law at play.  On the other hand,
    Moore's Law is just a statement about transistors density increasing over
    time.  It was the smartphone industry that got everyone to shift focus
    from building more
    and more powerful computers, to cheaper and less power-hungry computers.
</p>

<h5>The Cloud</h5>
<p>
    The second trend enabling IoT is the maturity and commoditization of cloud
    infrastructure.  It is easier than ever to build scalable, highly-available
    cloud-based services, using tools like AWS and NoSQL databases.  For the
    past several years, this trend has been driven by demand for web services
    and cloud-based apps.
</p>

<h5>Improved Wireless</h5>
<p>
    Lastly, wireless technology is undergoing a silent revolution.  New
    technologies like Bluetooth LE, 6LOPAN, are Thread and simplifying RF
    communications and bringing down the cost and power consumption of wireless
    interactions.
</p>

<h5>The Result is IoT</h5>
<p>
    These trends together are fundamentally changing how consumers interact
    with products.
</p>
<p>
    With cheap, small &amp; efficient processors, we can start to put a CPU in
    everything.
</p>
<p>
    With cheap, small &amp; efficient wireless, we can start to connect everything to the Internet.
</p>
<p>
    With cheap and scalable cloud infrastructure, we can start to monitor and
    control everything over the Internet (through smartphone apps).
</p>
<h4>The Cloud's Role</h4>
<p>
    Just because we <i>can</i> build devices that talk to the cloud, it might
    not be obvious why we would want to do this.
