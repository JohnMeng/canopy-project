<h3>2.1 Cloud Variables - About Cloud Variables</h3>

<p>
    In this chapter we'll see how Cloud Variables make it easy to add
    cloud-based remote control and monitoring capabilities to your product.
</p>

<h4>What is a Cloud Variable?</h4>
<p>
    A Cloud Variable is a piece of data that is stored in the cloud and is
    associated with a particular device.
</p>
<p>
    Cloud Variables simplify the development of smart products by helping with:
    <ul>
        <li>Time-series sensor data storage in the cloud.</li>
        <li>Device status reporting &amp; monitoring.</li>
        <li>Remote device configuration.</li>
        <li>Remote device control.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    In many ways, a Cloud Variable is like a traditional variable in a computer
    program.  Each Cloud Variable has a name, such as <code>temperature</code>.
    Each has a datatype, such as <code>float32</code>.  Each has a value, such
    as <code>98.7</code>.  Cloud Variables may be members of structures
    (<code>gps.latitude</code>), and the structures themselves are considered
    Cloud Variables (<code>gps</code>).  You can create arrays of Cloud
    Variables (<code>cpu_level[3]</code>) as well as associative arrays
    (<code>weight['Johny']</code>).
</p>
<p>
    In other ways, Cloud Variables are critically different from normal
    programming variables.  First of all, Cloud Variables are stored in a NoSQL
    database and are accessed using RESTful web-based protocols.  This makes
    them several orders-of-magnitude slower than normal variables, but also
    makes them persistent and accessible from anywhere in world (or at least
    anywhere with an internet connection).  A second difference is that the
    historical values for each Cloud Variable are saved in the database and
    kept for some time.  This makes them well-suited for storing sensor data
    and other time-series data.  A third difference is that each Cloud Variable
    has additional <b>metadata</b> associated with it that may include input
    validation constraints (<code>min-value : -50.0</code>), units
    (<code>units : "degrees_c"</code>) and hints about usage for
    third-party applications (<code>numeric-display-hint :
    "scientific"</code>).
</p>

<h4>Supported Languages and Platforms</h4>
<p>
    Canopy Cloud Variables are intended to be <b>agnostic</b> to programming
    language, IDE, and hardware platform.  To achieve this, we embrace web
    technologies (such as HTTP, REST, WebSockets, and JSON) which are supported
    in nearly every programming language on practically every hardware
    platform.
</p>
<p>
    The reality, however, is slightly murkier.  Although you <i>could</i> use
    our <b>HTTP REST API</b> directly, doing so may involve a lot of code and
    may not have great performance.  It is better to use a <b>Native Client
    Library</b>.  The Native Client Libraries are easier to use and have better
    performance because they use WebSockets to communicate with the server.
</p>
<p>
    At this time, we have official support for the following Native Client
    Libraries:

    <ul>
        <li><b>Embedded:</b> C Client Library (requires linux-based OS)</li>
        <li><b>Application:</b> Javascript Client Library (in-browser only)</li>
    </ul>

    If you are a developer, one of the best ways to contribute to the Canopy
    open source project is to develop a Native Client Library for your favorite
    language.
