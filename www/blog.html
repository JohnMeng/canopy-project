            <h1>Democratizing IoT -- Or Why WoT is the Better Name</h1>

            Let me begin with a tale from recent history.  If you happen to
            be old enough, you may remember life before the World Wide Web.  At
            the time, there <i>was</i> the Internet -- that's been around much
            longer -- but the Web didn't exist yet. Or if it did, no one had
            heard of it.

            <p>Back in those days there were a lot of "online services".  Compuserve,
            Prodigy, and AOL are the platforms I remember growing up with.
            Internally, they all used Internet technologies, such as the
            Internet Protocol (IP), and you could do Internet Stuff like
            send email between services.

            <p>But at the end of the day, these online platforms were walled
            gardens.  The content you had access to was restricted to whatever
            content your particular service decided to offer you, often based
            on the business deals and partnerships they had in place.

            <p>Then, one day, this guy named Tim Berners-Lee came along.  He
            believed that content publishing and access on the Internet needed
            to be democratized.  The online platforms like AOL shouldn't get to
            decide what content you can access.  Instead, individuals and
            independent organizations should be able to create and share
            <i>anything they choose</i> with <i>anyone they choose</i> by
            simply running a web server program on their computer.

            <p>Tim Berners-Lee started the World Wide Web by inventing those
            now-famous technologies such as HTTP and HTML.  Which brings us to
            one final note on this history lesson - the cornerstone of the Web
            are these <i>software standards</i>, not any particular piece of
            software.  For example, web servers come and go (apache was once
            the undisputed champ, but now nginx is giving it a run for the
            money), but HTTP and HTML are what allow all parties on the Web to
            interoperate.

            <p>Ok, enough history. How does this relate to the Internet of
            Things?  Well, today, we are in a very similar situation as we were
            in those early days of online services.  There is industry-wide interest
            in the IoT, and smart "devices" are solving many real-world
            problems today.  But, unfortunately, the IoT platforms
            du jour are proprietary, walled gardens.  Don't get me wrong: <a href=http://nest.com>Nest</a>,
            <a href=http://smartthings.com>SmartThings</a>, <a href=http://evrything.com>Evrything</a>, <a href=http://jasper.com>Jasper</a>, <a href=http://arrayent.com>Arrayent</a> and others are doing some very
            cool stuff.  But it is far from democratic.  If I buy a Nest
            thermostat, it will only talk to Nest's servers and can only be used
            with Nest's apps.  If I'm a geek hobbyist who creates a smart beer
            home-brewing system, my system cannot use Jasper's IoT platform
            without lawyers and complex business agreements in place.

            <p>To put it another way: today we've got the IoT -- walled garden
            platforms that use Internet techologies.  Let's now shift focus
            towards building the Web of Things (WoT) -- a democratized and
            standards-based approach to the application layer.

            <p>With <span class=logo-in-text>canopy</span> this is our vision.
            Anyone should be able to create a smart devices.  Anyone owning a
            smart device should be able to choose which cloud service their
            device is talking to.  And anyone should be able to write an
            application that interacts with any smart device.

            <p>The <span class=logo-in-text>canopy</span> open standards and open source
            software projects are beginning to make this vision possible.  Our <span
            class=logo-in-text>Smart Device Description Language</span>, or <span
            class=logo-in-text>SDDL</span>, lets you describe the sensors and controls on
            your device in a standardized way.  Our embedded software library, <span
            class=logo-in-text>libcanopy</span> can get your device speaking our <span
            class=logo-in-text>canopy PROTOCOL</span> with just a couple dozen lines of
            code.  The <span class=logo-in-text>canopy PROTOCOL</span> is itself an open
            and royalty-free standard.  Likewise, on the cloud and application side.  The
            entire <span class=logo-in-text>canopy</span> framework is open source and
            royalty-free, bringing interoperability, interchangeability, and
            democratization to the Internet of Things.  Or should we say Web of Things?
