    <div class='big w400'>Want open standards and free software for the Internet of Things?</div>
    <br>Developing a cloud-managed product today is an expensive and challenging
    endevour.  We want to change that.  Software infrastructure for smart
    products should be freely available and easy to use.

    <br>
    <br>Today's consumers expect a seamless experience from their smart
    devices, with beautiful UIUX, watertight security, and flawless
    performance.
    Canopy helps device makers exceed these expectations.  As an
    end-to-end solution with a modular design, device makers can leverage as
    much or as little of the platform as they need.

    <br>
    <br>If you're excited by this project and our vision, you can support us as
    a sponsor.
