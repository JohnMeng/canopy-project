    <div class=big>What is Canopy?</div>
    Canopy is an Internet of Things software platform, similar to <a target=_blank
    href=http://winkapp.com>Wink</a> or <a target=_blank href=http://arrayant.com>Arrayant
    Connected Platform</a>.  Canopy lets you remotely control, monitor, and
    share physical devices, from anywhere, using your smartphone or web
    browser.
    <p>
        Unlike other IoT platforms, Canopy is completely open source and
        royalty free.  Canopy provides a standardized format for describing the
        capabilities of a smart product.  Canopy transforms this
        description into software objects that can easily be used by
        application developers.
    </p>

    <div class=big>Why is Canopy open source?</div>
    Today, the Internet of Things is dominated by proprietary platforms.
    We think it should be more like the World Wide Web: based on royalty-free
    standards and open source software.
    
    <p>
        Most of the appliances in our homes and workplaces
        will soon be connected to the Internet.  Many companies want to control
        the underlying IoT infrastructure with proprietary software.  That way,
        they can charge expensive licensing and service fees and profit from
        <i>your</i> data.
    <p>
    <p>
        At Canopy, we have a different mindset.  We want to foster an open IoT
        ecosystem that encourages interoperability and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>We belive a
        product's <i>owner</i> should be able to choose whose "cloud" it
        is talking to, or even run a Canopy cloud server from home if she
        chooses.
    </p>
    <p>We believe it should be free and simple for manufacturers to make their
        products "smart" with Canopy, without us even knowing.
    </p>
    <p>We believe application developers should be able to interact with physical devices
        using standardized interfaces and libraries. 
    </p>
    <p>Philosophy aside, there are many practical benefits to open source model.  Making the
    software free and publicly-available encourages adoption.  Also, the code
    benefits from community contributions and bug fixes.

    <br><div class=big>How is Canopy funded?</div>
    Currently, Canopy is self-funded by the lead developer.  If you know of any
    sponsorship or funding opportunities, please let us know!</a>

    <br><br><div class=big>How will Canopy make money?</div>
    The Canopy team will host the "official" deployment of the Canopy Cloud
    Service.  It will be free for devices to connect and free for users to
    join.  We will offer premium service to users for a small monthly fee
    ($1/device/month).

    <br><br><div class=big>What hardware is needed?</div>

    <br><div class=big>Is Canopy secure?</div>
    Security is perhaps the biggest concern people have about IoT.  Needless to
    say, we take it seriously.
    <p>
        In our opinion, the best way to make IoT secure is to leverage the
        security mechanisms and best practices that make the web secure.  The
        technology that keeps my online banking transactions secure can be used
        to prevent hackers from opening my garage door or starting my
        dishwasher.
    </p>
    We are working on documenting a comprehensive threat model and commited.

    <br><br><div class=big>What products use Canopy?</div>
    At this time, no commercial products are using it, but stay tuned.  You
    can make your computer or Raspberry Pi Canopy-enabled in just a few
    lines of code by following this <a target=_blank href=api_docs/tutorial.html>tutorial</a>.

    <br><div class=big></div>
    <p>
        We believe that the Internet of Things, like the World Wide Web, should
        be based on open standards
